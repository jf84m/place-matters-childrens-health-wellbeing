We recognize there is variability, but presented the information in a way that could be easily interpreted.",The project also seeks to show the impact of risks and assets on social mobility and life expectancy. We hope to provide a roadmap for the city to build upon existing assets and work to address the significant inequities in our city.,"Philadelphia has many assets to strengthen.

Philadelphia can only be a world class city if its children are living in healthy neighborhoods that provide equitable opportunities for optimal health and well-being.
